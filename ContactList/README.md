# ContactList
An Android application that stores contact information in an SQLite database.

Utilizing the Android Room Persistance Library, this application includes a RoomDatabse, repository, DAO, and entities. It also includes a Fragment plus ViewModel design, a RecyclerView.Adapter plus CardView layout, and a number of AsyncTasks. The user interface features a Floating Action Button, as well as an overflow menu. Custom Toasts are used to communicate with the user.

The application can be installed on a physical Android device via Android Studio.

NOTE: The application is still under construction. Although the current version runs without error, there is always room for improvement.
